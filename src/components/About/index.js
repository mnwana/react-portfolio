      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Marielle Nwana and I'm an NYC-based data analyst.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Proven understanding of data analytics and engineering tools and
        passionate about data accessibility and data literacy. Experience
        includes leading projects within data teams, presenting data driven
        insights to leadership, and partnering across engineering, business and
        sales teams to transform raw data into data tools and dashboards for
        internal and external measurement. Thrives in high-growth startup
        environments where there is a good balance of autonomy and
        collaboration.
        <br></br><br></br>
        When I'm not working, I enjoy trying out new recipes, playing with my
        cat Molly, and exporing all that New York has to offer.
